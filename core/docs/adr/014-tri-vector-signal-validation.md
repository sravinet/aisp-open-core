# ADR-014: Tri-Vector Signal Validation

## Status

**IMPLEMENTED** - Completed and Integrated

## Context

The AISP 5.1 specification defines a foundational tri-vector signal decomposition:
- Signal ≜ V_H ⊕ V_L ⊕ V_S
- V_H ≜ ℝ⁷⁶⁸ (semantic meaning)
- V_L ≜ ℝ⁵¹² (structural relationships) 
- V_S ≜ ℝ²⁵⁶ (safety constraints)

With critical orthogonality constraints:
- V_H ∩ V_S ≡ ∅ (semantic and safety spaces are orthogonal)
- V_L ∩ V_S ≡ ∅ (structural and safety spaces are orthogonal)
- V_H ∩ V_L ≢ ∅ (semantic and structural may overlap)

The current formal verification system recognizes tri-vector syntax but lacks deep validation of the mathematical properties and constraints that make AISP's safety guarantees possible.

## Decision

Implement comprehensive tri-vector validation that:

1. **Validates Vector Space Definitions**
   - Verify dimensionality constraints (768+512+256=1536)
   - Check vector space axioms (closure, associativity, etc.)
   - Validate direct sum properties

2. **Enforces Orthogonality Constraints**
   - Prove V_H ⊥ V_S mathematically
   - Prove V_L ⊥ V_S mathematically
   - Allow controlled V_H ∩ V_L overlap

3. **Validates Signal Decomposition**
   - Ensure any Signal can be uniquely decomposed into (V_H, V_L, V_S)
   - Verify lossless reconstruction: Signal = project_H + project_L + project_S
   - Check decomposition stability under transformations

4. **Safety Isolation Verification**
   - Prove safety constraints cannot be optimized away
   - Verify semantic changes cannot affect safety space
   - Validate safety-critical property preservation

5. **Integration with Formal Verification**
   - Use Z3 to prove orthogonality properties
   - Generate counterexamples for violated constraints
   - Provide formal certificates for valid decompositions

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Vector Space Foundation
- Implement mathematical vector space operations
- Add dimensionality validation
- Create orthogonality checking algorithms

### Phase 2: Signal Decomposition
- Implement tri-vector signal representation
- Add decomposition/reconstruction algorithms
- Validate unique decomposition property

### Phase 3: Safety Isolation Proofs
- Prove semantic optimization cannot affect safety
- Implement safety constraint preservation checks
- Add formal verification integration

### Phase 4: Z3 Integration
- Generate SMT-LIB formulations of constraints
- Integrate with existing Z3 verification pipeline
- Add proof certificate generation

## Benefits

1. **Mathematical Rigor**: Formal validation of AISP's core mathematical foundation
2. **Safety Guarantees**: Prove safety constraints are truly isolated
3. **Specification Compliance**: Full alignment with AISP 5.1 tri-vector requirements
4. **Early Detection**: Catch tri-vector violations at validation time
5. **Formal Certificates**: Generate machine-checkable proofs of correctness

## Risks

1. **Complexity**: Vector space mathematics adds significant implementation complexity
2. **Performance**: Orthogonality proofs may be computationally expensive
3. **False Positives**: Overly strict validation might reject valid edge cases
4. **Maintenance**: Requires ongoing mathematical expertise

## Consequences

- AISP documents will require valid tri-vector definitions to pass formal verification
- Safety-critical applications get mathematical guarantees about constraint isolation
- Specification compliance improves significantly
- Foundation for implementing remaining AISP features (pocket architecture, ghost search)

## Validation Criteria

A tri-vector validation passes if and only if:

1. ✅ Vector spaces have correct dimensions (768, 512, 256)
2. ✅ V_H and V_S are provably orthogonal  
3. ✅ V_L and V_S are provably orthogonal
4. ✅ Signal decomposition is unique and lossless
5. ✅ Safety constraints are isolated from semantic optimization
6. ✅ Z3 generates formal proof certificate
